Problem Statement
Visitors to a Park
You are given an array of integers representing the daily number of visitors to a park.

You need to design a system that allows you to efficiently answer queries about the total number of visitors in a given range of days. Implement a function that preprocesses the array and then answers queries about the total number of visitors for a specific range of days.

Time complexity should be O(n+q) where n is the number of visitors and q is the number of queries.

Example:

Input:

visitors = [3, 7, 2, 8, 5, 9]
queries = (1, 4), (0, 3), (2, 5)

Output: 
22
20
24
Explanation:

For the first query (1, 4), the total visitors are 7 + 2 + 8 + 5 = 22.
For the second query (0, 3), the total visitors are 3 + 7 + 2 + 8 = 20.
For the third query (2, 5), the total visitors are 2 + 8 + 5 + 9 = 24.

Each line in the output represents the total visitor for the query.

Constraints:
visitors: 1 <= len(visitors) <= 10^5)

Exercise - 1

Input:
3 7 2 8 5 9 //visitors array
3 // number of queries
1 4 //each tuple of query with start day and end day

Output:
22
20
