Problem Statement
Elimination Game
You are given a list 'arr' containing integers in the range from 1 to 'n', arranged in strictly increasing order. You need to perform the following algorithm on 'arr':

Start from the left and remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.
Repeat the previous step, but this time from the right, remove the rightmost number and every other number from the remaining numbers.
Keep repeating the steps, alternating left to right and right to left, until only one number remains in the list.

Your task is to determine the last number that remains in the 'arr' list after applying the algorithm.

Constraints:
The value of 'n' is between 1 and 10^9 (1 <= n <= 10^9).

Important Note: Ensure that you save your solution before progressing to the next question and before submitting your answer.
